Personal CLI bot to automate all my common tasks. Jarvis can be executed from anywhere in the terminal

Current tasks Jarvis can perform:

`jarvis pdf split [filename]`
Splits a pdf into individual pages. Useful for submitting school assignments

`jarvis git open`
Opens the GitHub repository of the current folder, if it exists
